# LANDMARK FINDER

An app where users will get directions and contact information to nearby historical landmarks, based on a search radius they specified. The landmarks will be shown in a list where the user will be able to take themselves to either Google Maps or Waze to be directed to the landmark. If a website or contact number are available, the user would have access to them as well.
